## Cosmere Compendium

Project roughly based on [The Wheel of Time Encyclopedia](http://www.encyclopaedia-wot.org/) except for the Cosmere universe by Brandon Sanderson.  This is the initial intent though I feel once this project has some initial structure I believe it can be generalized to any book or series.  I think this style of structuring data describing a book or series is extremely useful and far better than most current forms (cliff notes, wiki, etc.).

I feel as everything should stem solely from literature material.  Any external information should be specifically referenced as such.  Primarily, all information should be "canonical" based on the published material and everything should be referenced back to at minimum a source down to the source chapter level (if not further).
